    "## Interacting with the Book\n",
    "The code snippets in the book are all written in Python through Jupyter notebooks. Familiarity with the Python language and its scientific packages is useful, but not required.  There are introductory guides to [Python](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Preamble/Python-basics.html) and [Markdown](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Preamble/Markdown-basics.html) in the **Preamble**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is meant to be interactive, where you can open each chapter using [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) (see below) from the dropdown menu shown with a rocket.  The runtime on Google Colab uses a version of Python that already has many useful packages (e.g., numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.) available with an import statement.  Each cell can be modified and executed, which is only limited by your curiosity.  Also, the text cells can be opened to reveal the source markup and formatting.\n",
