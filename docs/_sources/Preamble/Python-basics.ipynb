    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted high-level programming language that converts human-friendly commands into computer instructions.  This means that it takes human-readable code as input and then interprets the code into machine language.  In a sense, other computer languages involve a similar process; however languages like C/C++ or Fortran are much more efficient at it.  But, those languages are categorized as compiled languages because they are converted to machine code once the compilation process is complete.  Python programs are analyzed by the interpreter \"on the fly\", which causes Python to run much slower.  Luckily, hardware and software (OS) improvements have been so dramatic over the past 30+ years that the hit to performance is not as noticeable.  The advantage to coding in an interpreted language is that it is easier to tweak and debug because the variables are stored in local memory and there is no need to re-compile with every change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python can be easily run from the command-line, which allows users to experiment with Python commands without having to create a fully fledged program.  For this course, we will make use of Jupyter notebooks, which are similar to notebooks in Mathematica.  In the previous chapter, we experimented with storing variables and creating a numpy array.  Python can be used for arithmetic tasks as well.  Try this:"

    "## Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, I hinted at the different types of variables in Python.  Those are the typical variables that exist in all programming languages.  However, there are two broad divisions in variable types in Python: a) *numeric* and *sequence* types. Numeric types hold a single number, such as an integer, floating point number, or a complex number (e.g., 2-3*i*).  Sequence types hold multiple objects (imagine a filled grocery bag), which could be single numbers, characters, or even collections of different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric Types\n",
    "    - **Integer**: The integer is the simplest numeric type in Python.  They are useful for counting items or tracking indices in an array. The maximum 32 bit integer is $2^{31}$ - 1 = 2,147,483,647\n",
    "    - **Long Integer**: Integers larger than $2^{31}$ - 1 are stored automatically as long integers.  When you use the *type* function on them, there is a trailing \"L\" to indicate it is a long integer.\n",
    "    - **Float**: The *floating point* type is a number containing a decimal point.  Floats require more memory to store and are slower in calculations.  Python up-converts variable types (recall the 1/2 = 0 vs 1./2 = 0.5 distinction).\n",
    "    - **Complex**: Complex numbers are naturally included in Python, but uses $j\\equiv\\sqrt{-1}$. For example, $x=0.5+1.2j$ is a valid complex number.\n",
    "- Sequence Types\n",
    "    - **Tuple**: Tuples are indicated by parentheses (). Items in tuples can be any other data type, including other tuples.  Tuples are *immutable*, meaning that once defined their contents cannot change.\n",
    "    - **List**: Lists are indicated by square brackets [] and are almost the same as tuples.  However, lists are *mutable*: individual items in a list can be changed.\n",
    "    - **String**: A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are surrounded by either double \\\" or single \\' quotes.  Strings are *immutable* (like tuples), but can only include characters.\n",
    "        - *Reserved characters*: Some characters are reserved (like \\# for comments), but can be used with an escape \\\\.  \n",
    "        - *Tab and Newline*: To indicate a <tab> character, use an escape \\\\ + t (\"\\t\").  A similar approach is used for a newline (\"\\n\").\n",
    "    - **Dictionary**: Dictionaries are indicated by curly brackets {}. The are different because they use \"keys\" (which are string labels) instead of numeric indices. Dictionaries are useful when managing data, where you want to assign the column header of a table as the key instead of referencing the column index.\n",

Functions are defined using **def** and the function name must start with a letter, while the rest of the name can be composed of numbers, letters or underscore.  After the function name, there is a set of () that contains a list of input variables that are passed to the function.  The def command should end with a colon (:).  The lines following the def command are an indented block and non-indented lines (relative to the def command) are outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the first line of a function is a comment block that describes the use of the function, including any assumptions for the input variables (e.g., type, format).  A function can return a value, but this is not required and depends on the inheritance of variables.  The return value can be numerical or a boolean (True or False)."

    "\n",
    "Python programs allow for a lot of flexibility, which is one of its strengths.  However, this much freedom can also be a source of confusion.  When we develop a program, we must employ some convention to make it easier for others to read and/or use.  This is similar to how we choose to write from left to right or drive on the *right* side of the road (those silly Brits).  As a result a common program structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#Program title\n",
    "#short description\n",
    "\n",
    "Import block #all import statements (numpy,scipy,matplotlib,etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Define constants #defining physical constants like G, k, c, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function block # define each function (preferably in alpha order)\n",
    "\n",
    "Main program #this is where the magic happens\n",
    "\n",
    "Program end #sometimes you need to close the opened objects (files, figures, processing pool, etc.)\n",
