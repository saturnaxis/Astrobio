    "# Origins of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Crucial Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is This Question Important?\n",
    "Our current sample for life in the universe is limited to on or near the surface of our home planet.  Therefore, one of our first questions considers how life first took root here, and whether things that we would consider alive exist elsewhere.  The fossil record on Earth appears to extent to about 3.5 Gyr ago and isotopic evidence suggests the presence of life several hundred million years before that.  However, no hard evidence exists concerning the mechanism by which life first began on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every human culture has developed an answer to this question and considered its importance in defining our place in the cosmos.  in the absence of firm evidence, the door has been left open to a variety of answers from science, mythology, and religion.  Each of these modes approaches our place in the Universe in a different way and with a different purpose.  These points of view can be broadly separated into three groups: Biblical-Creationist, Improbable Event, and Cosmic Evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group I: Biblical-Creationist\n",
    "In the Biblical-Creationist view, life began directly through the actions of a Creator *using supernatural means*.  This view is accepted by a large fraction of our population, although it is not testable and hence, non-scientific.  A modified version of this theory is *Intelligent Design*, which states that life on Earth arose through the actions of an intelligent being and does not identify the creator or specify the means that were used to create life.  This solves the problem of what delivered the initial spark, where there is disagreement concerning how much involvement the intelligent being has with the seeds of life are planted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we presume that creation is generated supernaturally, then we leave the realm for which science can answer questions and our tools are no longer effective for separating fact from fiction.  [Francis Crick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick) has suggested that life began on Earth when intelligent beings from a far-off planet delivered it (intentionally or not) by releasing bacteria from a spaceship (i.e., directed panspermia; [Crick & Orgel (1973)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901103?via%3Dihub)).  This explanation is not very satisfying because it merely shifts the problem from the beginnings of life on Earth to the beginnings of life in the Universe, which is a much more untenable issue to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Group II: Improbable Event\n",
    "Another point of view is that life began through natural causes, but the events that lead to this process were extremely improbable.  From this premise, it follows that life anywhere (beyond this planet) may be rare and the remainder of the Universe may be barren.  Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "One has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that spontaneous generation is impossible, Yet we are here - as a result, I believe, of spontaneous generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is in fact the hero of the plot.  The time with which we have to deal is of the order of two billion years.  Given so much time, the `impossible' becomes possible, the possible probable, and the probable virtually certain.  One has only to wait: time itself performs the miracles.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- George Wald ([1954](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1954SciAm.191b..44W/abstract))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current thinking, the amount of time available is only ${\\sim}500$ Myr rather than 2 Gyr, though the maximum amount of space that can be used for random trials is presumably the same (i.e., the surface of the Earth and the areas that exchange material with it).  Both could be expanded greatly if the possibility of [panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia) were taken into account.  Panspermia presumes that life can be spread from world to world by spores (or within meteors) through space.  Much of the Universe and much of the time since creation would then be available for trials on the origin of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "An improbable event requires us to understand a bit about probability itself (i.e., What are the chances?).  Given the age of our Universe and that it's filled with billions upon billions of stars, small improbabilities can multiply.  For example, how long would it take to generate the word \"at\" on my computer keyboard by random strokes?  Assume that I limit my strokes to the fifty keys that produce characters, and I could carry out one trial per second.  My chances would be 1 in 2500 ($50^2 = 50 \\times 50$), which means that I could expect to produce this word within about 45 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we raise the difficulty level: *What are the chances that I could type this line at random?*  The italicized sentence has 48 characters (ignoring the spaces).  The odds of getting the order completely correct would be 1 in $50^{48}$, about 1 in $4\\times 10^{81}$!  If we consider 6 billion humans performing one trial per second and an Earth-like planet orbited every star within every Galaxy of the Universe ever since the Big Bang, then the odds would still be less than 1 in $10^{30}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The incredibly slim chances for success would be masked if one broke up that sentence into small fragments which were considered individually.  The chances for getting the first two characters right in a finite time would seem reasonable.  If we assume (wrongly) that the whole is the sum (rather than the product) of its parts, the entire sequence seems reasonable.  This type of reasoning  underlies much of the approach used for what is called *prebiotic synthesis*.  A number of steps is demonstrated separately in a laboratory, each under conditions that may have prevailed in one location or another on the early Earth.  The products of the reaction are then termed *prebiotic* a distinction that allows the experimenter to use any of the reactions in a subsequent prebiotic transformation.  Little consideration is given to the adverse probabilities generated by the numerous processes which are implied by the suggested sequence of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This inevitably leads to odds that makes the overall process seem near miraculous.  With some good fortune, such an event (i.e., combination of the correct compounds for life) might have occurred within the history of the Universe, and given rise to us.  A consequence of this theory would be that separate origins of life would very rare in the Universe.  Panspermia would still be a possibility, but any life that we encountered elsewhere would then be related to our own.  Astrobiology would represent a simple extension of Earth biology."

    "#### Group III: Cosmic Evolution\n",
    "In this viewpoint, life began through the inevitable consequences from the laws of nature.  There exists a principle of self-organization that has guided the development of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present.  Life is common in the Universe.  It will arise whenever a prerequisite set of materials interacts with a suitable energy source.  Life's origin is not liked to the improbable formation of a particular functioning large biomolecule, and it requires a much simpler set of ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a suitable source of free energy,\n",
    "- a set of chemicals that can utilize energy to increase its own ability to survive, and\n",
    "- an environment that is sufficiently stable so that the evolving system is not disrupted by extreme changes in conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory encourages the expectation that life is likely to arise on other worlds that have enjoyed Earth-like conditions during some part of their history.  No recipe for a specific set of ingredients for life is offered.  The possibility remains open that alternative lifeforms may rise in environments that are very different than Earth but still meet the necessary requirements for life.  This stance towards the origin of life is the most optimistic for the field of astrobiology, but it remains to be demonstrated that it is correct."

    "### Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spontaneous Generation\n",
    "For millennia, the consensus favored *spontaneous generation*, where life may arise quickly by chance from non-living matter and independent of the action of parents.  Aristotle and his followers claimed that fireflies emerged from morning dew from their many observations in which they suddenly appeared.  Many kinds of small animals seemed to arise from the mud at the bottom of ponds and streams.  The 17th century philosopher Ren&eacute; Descartes suggested that the process was driven by heat agitating the subtle and dense particles of putrefying matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through careful experimental tests to these speculative ideas, scientists found negative results for a whole array of lower lifeforms.  By the mid-19th century, the spontaneous generation question had contracted to the realm of microorganisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "The cell theory was modified in the 1860s so that protoplasm came to be considered the structural unit of life.  Moreover, this protoplasm was viewed as an essentially simple substance, theoretically capable of bing produced directly from inorganic matter.  That the simples organism were generally regarded merely as naked lumps of protoplasm added credence to the belief that they, too, could be produced spontaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "--John Farley ([1977](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Spontaneous_Generation_Controversy_f/1uHaAAAAMAAJ?hl=en))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradigm collapsed in the late 19th century as a result of the experiments of [Louis Pasteur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur).  Pasteur proclaimed in an 1862 lecture at the Sorbonne, \"never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment.\"  Pasteur heated and thus sterilized a broth of sugared yeast water, which showed that a solution could be devoid of life and did not spontaneously accumulate microbes until direct contact with the outside air was re-established.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments similar to Pasteur's demonstrated that all living things arise today from existing life.  The results were comforting to those with the Biblical-Creationist view, where a Creator was necessary to bring life to the world for the first time.  This included Pasteur himself:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "What a victory for materialism if it could be affirmed that it rests on the established fact that matter organizes itself, takes on life itself, matter which has in it already all known forces! ... Of what good would it be then to have recourse to the idea of a primordial creation, before which mystery it is necessary to bow?  What good then would be the idea of a Creator God?\n",
    "\n",

    "A scientific (rather than theologic) view need to push the origin back to an earlier era when conditions on the Earth were very different, and when timespans greater than a few days could be invoked.  It was recognized that the generation of a fully equipped modern functioning cell might not be necessary to get life going.  Some simpler system which utilized only a portion of a cell might suffice."

    "#### The Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis\n",
    "This theory proposed separately by [Alexander Oparin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Oparin) and [J.B.S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane) stated that life arose slowly on the early Earth in a \"prebiotic soup\" of chemicals that covered the planet through a series of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The early Earth had an oxygen-free atmosphere, but contained ammonia, hydrogen gas, water, and methane (i.e., reduced carbon bound to hydrogen).\n",
    "2. This atmosphere was exposed to a variety of energy sources: solar radiation, meteorite and comet infall, volcanic eruptions, lightning, and others, which led to the formation of organic compounds.\n",
    "3. These substances \"must have accumulated until the primitive oceans reached the consistency of hot dilute soup\" as stated by Haldane.  [Harold Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey) suggested that the soup components, \"would remain for long periods of time in the primitive oceans. ... This would provide a very favorable situation for the origin of life.\" \n",
    "4. By unspecified transformations, life developed in this soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some elements of the hypothesis were demonstrated in a famous 1953 experiment by Urey and his student [Stanley Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Miller).  They set up a flask of boiling water to represent the oceans of the early Earth.  The water vapor passed through a compartment that held two electrodes and supported a spark discharge.  The spark served as an energy source and represented lightning.  After the vapors passed through the spark, they were condensed to water droplets that returned to the original flask.  The entire system was enclosed and filled with a mixture of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen gases to mimic the primitive atmosphere (as it was understood at the time).  The experiment was run for a week, in which all of the methane was consumed. *What was produced in its place?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The results apparently depended upon the arrangement of the compartments and the nature fo the spark.  The most exciting result was to produce a mixture containing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.  In a modified design, a hydrocarbon layer was formed that was devoid of amino acids.  A later experiment, an intermittent spark was used, but few organic compounds were produced.  Further studies were carried out under the conditions that afforded amino acids.\n",

    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The prominent product was a tar-like, insoluble substance that coated the walls of the vessel.  Fifteen percent of the methane had been converted to a mixture of simple organic compounds.  Fourteen of these compounds were present in yields over $0.1\\%$.  All of the compounds were organic acids (i.e., carboxylic acids), which may have been preserved from destruction by their formation of non-volatile ammonium salts.  The salts would have remained in the liquid phase and evaded continuous recycling through the spark.  Two amino acids produced are used in life's proteins, while the remainder are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment did confirm one tenet of the hypothesis: that an atmosphere of methane, hydrogen, and ammonia, when exposed to certain types of energy, would afford a mixture of organic compounds.  It revealed nothing about the processes that produce a living organism from such a mixture.  As our understanding of the complexity of life has increased, that problem has become more difficult over the next 50+ years."

    "#### Even the Simplest Forms of Life are Complex\n",
    "In the mid-19th century, a common scientific idea was that the building material of life was a pulpy, gel-like, structureless material called [protoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplasm).  In 1857, [Thomas Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley) dredged a \"transparent, gelatinous matter\" from the sea bottom and concluded it was protoplasm.  If the construction of life was relatively simple, then it would be not surprising if life could be prepared from simple broths of nutrients.  After 150 years of careful study, a very different picture emerged.  A bacterium is far more complex than the most intricate machine constructed by humans."

One arrangement is a [micelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle), which is a sphere with the hydrophilic groups on the surface and the hydrophobic ones within.  Another is a [bilayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_bilayer), with two aligned layers of amphiphiles arranged in a tail-to-tail structure that resembles a membrane.

    "#### Thermodynamics and Probability\n",
    "The [second law of thermodynamics](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_02/Physics_and_Astrophysics.html#laws-of-thermodynamics) specifies that spontaneous processes in a closed system are characterized by the conversion of order to disorder.  The entropy of the system (measure of disorder) must increase, but entropy is also associated with probability (i.e., a probability of possible states).  The formation of an organized system from disorder is not forbidden, but highly improbable.  Living systems \"pay\" for their existence by creating more disorder elsewhere in the system.  For example, they may convert nutrients to simpler chemicals, but the process causes a release of heat to the general environment and increases the disorder of that environment.  [*There's no such thing as a free lunch.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch)\n",
    "\n",
    "The spontaneous generation of a living bacterium from small molecules would be near-miraculous due to its interior complexity.  The odds that component atoms within a hot gas could self-assemble into a bacterium are more than astronomical ($1\\ \\text{in } 10^{10^{11}}$; [Morowitz 1968](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/6xE3AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiZ7Nvwvez4AhVMEGIAHcFZBFcQ7_IDegQIDxAE)).  Matters might improve by thousands of orders of magnitude if we started with an appropriate mixture of small molecular species, but the overall prospect would still be hopeless.  To reduce the improbability, scientists have suggested that life began with only a very limited subset of the components of a bacterial cell.  The heart of the origin-of-life problem lies in finding the way in which the initial functioning system was formed from disorganized chemical mixtures produced by the normal processes of abiotic chemistry. \n",

    "#### Separate Problems: Origin of Life vs. Origin of Organics\n",
    "In the early 19th century, many chemists felt that the distinction life and non-life lay in the very chemicals used to construct them.  Living systems contained carbon and the chemicals in them were called \"organic,\" while substances considered to be inorganic (with some exceptions) had no carbon.  This distinction was erased in 1828, when [Friedrich W&ouml;hler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler) prepared urea from another substance that was classified as organic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We now recognize that mixtures of simple organic chemicals are produced in many locations off this planet (e.g., carbonaceous chondrites, interstellar dust clouds, cometary tails, and the atmosphere of Titan). The most informative studies have been performed on meteorites, where they represent the products of authentic abiotic processes, and are amenable to detailed analyses in Earth-based laboratories.  The [Murchison meteorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite) has been subjected to extensive analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the meteorite are quite complex, where the bulk of the carbon present is in the form of insoluble macromolecules and soluble organic compounds comprise 10-20%.  The most predominant chemical class is organic sulfonic acids, followed by polar aromatic hydrocarbons, and carboxylic acids.  Amino acids occur at levels between $10-100$ ppm (1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than the aforementioned compounds), and the base components of nucleic acids at about 1 ppm.  Sugars and phosphate esters of all kinds are absent.  More than 70 amino acids have been detected in the Murchison meteorite, but only eight of the twenty needed for Earth-life were among them.\n",

    "#### Possibilities for Reduced Organics\n",
    "Underlying the Miller-Urey experiment was the assumption that the primitive atmosphere of the Earth was derived from solar nebula, and was therefore rich in hydrogen.  This explains the atmospheres of the outer Solar System planets, which have reducing atmospheres consisting of molecular hydrogen $\\rm H_2$ but not $\\rm H_2O$.  Subjecting an atmosphere rich in molecular hydrogen to energy from various sources was expected to give rise to a global \"prebiotic soup.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the current consensus suggests that any primary atmosphere of hydrogen was lost quickly and replaced by a [secondary atmosphere](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_03/Planetary_Heating_and_Atmospheres.html#history-of-secondary-atmospheres) due to outgassing from the planet.  While a prebiotic atmosphere for the early Earth may still be favored by some prebiotic chemists, the weight of the geochemical opinion favors and early (at least by the time life arose) atmosphere dominated by heavier gases.  This is in accord with current observations of volcanic emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organics could be supplied through infall of comets and meteorites, but the total quantity from these sources are expected to be small compared to the total volume required for global life.  It is not necessary to supply the entire globe with organics to furnish raw materials for the origin of life.  Some very specialized and favorable local environments may have been sufficient for the purpose, which was a view expressed by Darwin in 1871.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Darwin's \"warm little pond\" has been joined by several other suitable locations (e.g., hydrothermal vents).  Vent conditions have been shown suitable for mineral-catalyzed abiotic synthesis of a number of small organic molecules relevant to biochemistry.  Abiotic hydrocarbon reservoirs within mineral enclosures deep within Earth's crust represent another proposed site.  Igneous mineral matrices have been demonstrated suitable locations for assembly of carboxylic acids from $\\rm CO$ and $\\rm CO_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our current ignorance about the varieties of life in the Universe, we cannot exclude the alternative explanation that life began on this planet without the assistance of organic molecules.  In theory (from Cairns-Smith), layered clay minerals provide all of the necessary qualities needed to support life: information storage, reproductive ability, catalysis, and the capacity to evolve.  In this picture, organic molecules were introduced as an evolutionary improvement only after mineral life was well underway.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central problem for the origin of life remains, which is identifying mechanism by which an abiotic chemical mixture absorbs energy, increases in complexity, and evolves.  The availability of a suitable energy source, necessary raw materials, and a suitable locale are prerequisites, but not the answer to the riddle of self-organization.  In the search for that answer, investigators have a dilemma.  Which was first to appear on Earth: replicating molecules or metabolic processes?"

    "### Replicator-first Theories\n",
    "The discovery of the structure of DNA showed how hereditary material was stored, where the replicator DNA was at the center of our understanding of life.  The beauty of the double helix, which demonstrated how both reproduction and information storage could be carried out at the molecular level, convinced many in the field that nucleic acids were at the center of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of the Replicator Theory\n",
    "Darwin's theory of natural selection provided a path for the evolution of simple cells to humans.  It could be extended so that a replicator could also evolve by natural selection, but in an environment where molecules reproduced, mutated, and survived according to their ability to further reproduce in the environment.  To explain the origin of life, one only had to account for the origin of the first replicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerable support for finding the first replicator was provided by using the RNA of a virus called $\\rm Q\\beta$ in experiments by [Sol Spiegelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Spiegelman) and his group in the 1960s and 1980s.  $\\rm Q\\beta$ uses RNA rather than DNA as its genetic material, with replication carried out in a manner described by Watson and Crick.  In the presence of the appropriate polymerase enzyme and the four necessary building blocks (nucleoside triphosphates), the RNA can be replicated in a test tube.  The synthesized RNA can act as a template for producing more RNA, as long as the supplies of building blocks holds up.  Spiegelman's group was able to  follow this process for a time equivalent of over 70 RNA \"generations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In one thought-provoking experiment, Spiegelman's group added a drug that bound to certain sites on the RNA, which greatly slowed the copying rate.  After several generations the favored binding place of the drug had been destroyed by three mutations in the product RNA.  The product RNA had replicated more rapidly than other competing variations of the RNA, and its descendents soon became an overwhelming majority of the colony.  This process represented Darwinian evolution at the molecular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Problem with a Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: *A naked replicator could carry information, but could not carry out tasks today performed by proteins.*  The RNA replicator concept could not be extended immediately to the origin of life because a protein enzyme was needed for the copying to take place.  [Leslie Orgel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Orgel) described this paradox as \"the chicken or the egg\" problem.  A nucleic acid could be copied, and evolve through mutation, but could not by itself carry out the necessary catalytic functions.  Nucleic acids and protein both appear necessary for the conduct of life, but it is difficult to account for the appearance of either substance on the early Earth.  The abiotic formation of both together seemed out of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: *Life began with an \"RNA World.\"* [Thomas Cech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cech) and [Sidney Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Altman) showed that RNA molecules could carry out some of the functions of proteins.  The term *RNA World* was applied to describe the vision of [Walter Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert), where RNA alone performed all the key functions of life before proteins arrived on the scene.  The elegant way in which catalytic RNA appeared to solve the \"chicken and egg\" paradox led many to the conviction that RNA World existed in the earliest days of life on Earth.  Over several decades, biochemists developed techniques to demonstrate the ability of RNA to perform the actions of proteins.  However, this solution says little about the origin of life on Earth due to the absence of chemists and high-tech labs on the early Earth, and the extreme improbability of the abiotic synthesis of even a single functioning RNA molecule under realistic natural conditions.\n",

    "#### Just a Problem\n",
    "**Problem**: *RNA is too complicated to form spontaneously.*  Gilbert's seminal paper described RNA molecules catalyzing their own assembly from a \"nucleotide soup.\"  It was widely presumed that nucleotides were readily available on the early Earth.  However, this assumption has not been supported by evidence.  There are significant difficulties in synthesizing RNA by considering the likely abiotic availability of *adenosine*.  This substance has not been detected in any quantity within a Miller-Urey type experiment or a meteorite.  To get the necessary adenosine, it has been suggested that the base [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine) and the sugar ribose were formed separately, brought together, and combined.  *How likely are these events?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ribose formation**: The sugar ribose is the essential backbone component of RNA, where a reaction with formaldehyde has been generally cited as a plausible source of ribose on the early Earth.  However, the ribose soon decomposes.  The half-life for decomposition is around 73 minutes in an environment at $100\\ {\\rm ^\\circ C}$ at a pH of 7, and 44 years at $0\\ {\\rm ^\\circ C}$.  Ribose yields can be improved by adding specific minerals, careful control of experimental conditions, and by the input of pure reagents.  But, each such specification escalates the improbability that such conditions could naturally occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adenine formation**: Adenine can be prepared as long as the concentration of $\\rm HCN$ remains sufficiently high ($0.1$ Molarity ($\\rm M$)).  One estimate for a maximum plausible $\\rm HCN$ concentration in a prebiotic ocean of Earth has been $4\\times 10^{-5}\\ {\\rm M}$.  A remedy proposed for this situation was that the adenine was produced in lakes that froze seasonally, which concentrated the $\\rm HCN$.  However, there are several other necessary ingredients (e.g., ammonia), and the introduction of formaldehyde that tended to consume the $\\rm HCN$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combination of adenine and ribose to form adenosine**:  Assuming that adenine and ribose formed separately, there are complex reactions that could bring them together to react.  However, the product was not the one used in RNA.  A mixture containing some adenosine can be produced, but still in the presence of other [isomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomer) that would be expected to interfere with RNA synthesis.  Experiments could be constructed that violate no natural law, but would fall within the category of an extremely improbable event.  Some scientists feel that the current state of prebiotic chemistry reflects the presence of unanswered problems, which can be cured by the application of additional ingenuity."

    "### Pre-RNA World\n",
    "A number of scientists felt that the formation of the first replicator was coincident with the origin of life sought an alternative because they were unhappy with the prebiotic synthesis of RNA.  The task of the pre-RNA World advocates was to identify another polymeric substance that possessed the catalytic and self-replication abilities of RNA, while begin a more plausible product of abiotic synthesis.  Ideally this substance would form a stable double helix with an RNA strand to provide a mechanism for heritability (i.e., information transfer) during the course of evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two candidate structures were synthesized as part of a comprehensive effort to prepare analogs of DNA and RNA. One extensively investigated example was p-RNA (pyranosyl-RNA), which retained the sugar ribose, but replaced the five membered ring in RNA with a six-membered (pyranosyl) ring (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<RNA-fig>`).  Since free ribose in solution prefers a six-membered ring, the prospects for the abiotic synthesis of p-RNA would appear marginally better than RNA.  Another candidate RNA precursor is TNA (threose nucleic acid), which contains only four carbons, and may be more accessible to abiotic synthesis than ribose (see [Robertson & Joyce (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/) for more details).  A TNA strand will cross-pair with both RNA and DNA.  Despite these advantages, there are problems with sugar instability and other difficulties that apply to the abiotic synthesis of any sugar-based replicator.\n",

    "A third example of an RNA precursor is PNA (peptidyl nucleic acid), which escapes the complications of carbohydrate (sugar) chemistry.  The structure contains two alternating units and has no chiral center.  PNA can form stable double helices with itself, and it can cross-pair with RNA and DNA.  The evidence supporting PNA includes the traces of the fundamental repeating unit of the backbone were formed in a Miller-Urey spark discharge experiment, but at $<0.01\\%$ of the glycine.  It seems unlikely that the amount of PNA backbone component on the early Earth would approach that of its much simpler constituent, glycine."

Small molecules carried out the processes of catalysis, information storage, and reproduction using energy-driven cycles of chemical reactions.  In metabolism-first theories, a number of alternatives are presented for how the small molecules carry out basic life processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information is stored in the mixture**: A list storing all the information like DNA may be unnecessary.  A set of molecules within a primitive cellular compartment on the early Earth would carry their own heredity.

    "\n",
    "**Reproduction is carried out by splitting the compartment**: In the absence of a list, a primitive replicator-free cell could reproduce by collecting a duplicate set of its contents from the environment, and then splitting in two.  Improved ingredients could also be collected from the environment, which would be the equivalent of a mutation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Energy-driven catalytic cycles perform the essential processes of the cell**: Some possible functions of importance are the synthesis of improved catalysts and membrane components that permit improved interaction with the energy supply.  Possible energy sources include light, redox reactions involving organic substances, volatile inorganics and minerals, pH gradients, and ionic potentials across membranes.  It is not clear (at present) which of these was most suitable on the early Earth.\n",

The history of terrestrial life must act as the archetype for astrobiological models of the appearance and radiation of life anywhere in the Universe, albeit an ever more contingent and unique one.  It could be argued that all habitable planets experienced similar environmental constraints and pathways of physical and chemical development.  Then, the process of biological initiation elsewhere should be broadly reminiscent of Earth-like life.  If so, astrobiology is saved from the challenges of examining things far away, but is instead faced with the difficulties of examining events here long ago (i.e., trading deep space for deep time).

    "The origin and early evolutionary history of terrestrial life is poorly known, in addition to poor constraints on the environmental conditions of the early Earth.  There are several reasons for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ancient rocks are rare**: Almost all potential information about the first half of Earth's history is contained in geological materials.  Such rocks have been mostly hidden or destroyed by geological processes (e.g., erosion, burial, or subduction).  Some rocks from the early Earth were ejected into space by catastrophic meteorite impacts, of which there were plenty during the first billion years of Earth history.  Both geological or impact mechanisms are viable candidates for the destruction of the earliest crust.\n",
    "2. **Metamorphism and/or deformation damages the information content of rocks**:  Biological signatures are fragile, usually surviving only mild metamorphism and moderate deformation.  On a tectonically active planet, the cumulative probability of deep burial or intense folding steadily increases over time.  Radioactive heating was greater on the Archean Earth (2.5-4 Gyr ago), and tectonic activity may have been more intense, with post-depositional modification of rocks correspondingly more likely.  The effects of shock metamorphism during meteorite impacts could have also been severe, judging by the cratering on the Moon and Mars.  Temperatures above $300\\ {\\rm ^\\circ C}$ are significantly destructive to most chemical biosignatures.  Therefore rare, ancient rocks are even more rare to contain contain astrobiologically important information.\n",
    "   ```{note}\n",
    "    Metamorphism refers to mineralogical changes in rocks due to pressure and heat.  Deposition is the process of laying down a sedimentary layer, while post-depositional processes can later modify this layer in many ways and thus complicate its interpretation. \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Surviving rocks are located in unfortunate places**:  Many occur on continents where recent environmental conditions have been unfriendly to pristine preservation.  Some rocks are situated where prolonged weathering under subtropical climates has transformed most surface rocks into varieties of soil.  Others have endured glaciation over the past million years which has covered them with [till](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till), shattered them by frost action, swamped them with lakes, or encouraged the overgrowth lichens and mosses.  Fresh samples are obtained by drilling, but most core boring has occurred where the rocks are unrepresentative (e.g., in the vicinity of mines).  Mines are situated near the anomalous concentration of a particular element.\n",
    "4. **Not all rock were formed in settings likely to yield evidence of life**: Sedimentary rock are the only ones from which paleobiological data can be readily obtained.  For the early Earth, these are commonly [shales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale), [cherts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert), [banded iron formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation), and [carbonate rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate_rock). A few other rock types can yield important environmental information and biological relics (in exceptional instances), which include [sandstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone), [evaporites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporite), [hydrothermal deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_mineral_deposit), [tuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff), and [hyaloclastites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaloclastite).  The primordial geological record mainly consists of granites, basalts, and other highly metamorphosed and deformed materials.\n",
    "5. **Very few well-preserved remnants of the early Earth have not *yet* been studied systematically**: The geological features of the rocks and their environments must be understood before paleobiological and paleo-environmental interpretation can be deduced.  Moreover, primordial rocks and relics of early life might well have no modern analogs.  The introduction of younger material into older rocks (i.e., contamination) has plagued Archean paleontology because the opportunities are common during the long and complex geological history of even the best-preserved Archean rock.  Determining whether or not a specimen is of biological origin (i.e., biogenicity) is contentious for many putatively primordial fossils because early organisms are expected to be morphologically simple, chemically unsophisticated, and environmentally benign.  Distinguishing inorganic objects from primitive fossils is difficult.  Very little research has been performed on abiogenic mimics of possible early biosignatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all these shortcomings, every claimed Archean fossil must be subjected to strict scrutiny, if only because of the extreme improbability of their survival.

However, remnants of very small organisms are most prone to destruction by metamorphic and deformational recrystallization.  Microbial fossils are generally only preserved where lithification (entombment in rock) was almost instantaneous upon death, the host sediment is extremely fine in grain size, and the mineralizing material is hostile to microbial activity.  The two main rock types that satisfy these requirements are chert and shale.  \n",

It is very difficult to distinguish true prokaryotic microfossils from the many abiogenic structures that can mimic similar shapes.  The best way of discriminating fossilized simple lifeforms from non-life is to find evidence of past biological behavior that is not explicable in terms of physical or chemical processes (e.g., varying orientations with respect to environmental gradients or indications of reproduction).\n",
    "- Syngenicity arises as a problem becaus of the long and complex geological history even of the best preserved Archean rock.  This provides many potential opportunities for younger biological contaminants to infiltrate.  Contamination can sometimes only be distinguished by features like slightly discordant host rocks, lack of fossil-sediment interaction, or anomalous geochemistry compare to metamorphic grade.\n",

They are composed of replacive iron oxides ([kerogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerogen)) that has similar isotopic values to younger biogenic carbon.  Their complex divisional and matting habits are strongly reminiscent of biological behavior, and their irregular distribution aligned along their sediments' layering indicates contemporaneous deposition.  These objects are clearly syngentic and biogenic, which makes them incontestable Archean microfossils.  All older assemblages are more controversial.\n",

The constructing microbes accrete sediment by three distinct processes.\n",

    "#### Carbon Isotopes\n",
    "Both the microfossil and stromatolite records of the Archean are very patchy.  A more continuous record of Archean biology is preserved in a less direct way: in *isotopic chemofossils*, particularly the carbon isotope ratios of sedimentary rocks.  Autotrophic metabolisms that use $\\rm CO_2$ for manufacturing cellular carbon compounds preferentially incorporate the light stable isotope of carbon $\\rm ^{12}C$ over the heavy $\\rm ^{13}C$ into their synthesized organic matter.  Any sedimentary kerogen (iron oxides) derived from such organisms will inherit this isotopic fractionation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting the biological concentration of $\\rm ^{12}C$, sedimentary carbonate that is deposited from water bodies inhabited by autotrophs will consequently be depleted in $\\rm ^{12}C$, or relatively enriched in $\\rm ^{13}C$.  On Modern Earth, organic carbon has a carbon isotopic value (called $\\delta \\rm ^{13}C_{org}$) that averages around -22&permil; (i.e., depleted in $\\rm ^{13}C$ by 22 parts per thousand relative to an arbitrary standard), where carbonate has a $\\delta \\rm ^{13}C_{carb}$ of about 0&permil; and the entire Earth is near -6&permil;.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there are some complications to this simple picture.  Fluctuations in the fractionation record might be expected to appear at times when the burial ratio of sedimentary kerogen to carbonate varies or when the mean autotrophic fractionation between organic and inorganic carbon $\\Delta_{\\rm C}$ varies.  It appears that now is a somewhat unusual time in EArth history with very low $\\Delta_{\\rm C}$.  This may have resulted from declining atmospheric $\\rm pCO_2$ associated with the onset and growth of glaciers.  Overall it seems reasonable to assume that a global carbon cycle regulates the available carbon based on autotrophy of both independent microbes and endosymbiotic microbes (e.g., chloroplasts in plants and algae).\n",
    "\n",
    "When extrapolating back to more ancient rocks, one must consider a few complicating factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Older rocks tend to be metamorphosed, which contain a low $\\Delta_{\\rm C}$ that is indistinguishable from non-biologic fractionation.\n",
    "2. $\\rm ^{13}C_{org}$ can shift to heavier values at lower metamorphic grades becaus of loss of light hydrocarbons.\n",
    "3. Isotopically light hydrocarbons can migrate into ancient sedimentary rock and become solidified (i.e., contamination).\n",
    "4. [Metasomatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasomatism) (i.e., chemical alteration of the rock) and metamorphism can introduce secondary carbonate or graphite into ancient rocks by precipitation from or reaction with migrating fluids rich in dissolved carbonic species.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these mechanisms are apt to confound the ancient $\\Delta_{\\rm C}$ record, particularly in deformed and metamorphosed terrains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the pre-1.0 Ga carbon isotope record is similar to that of more modern times. $\\delta \\rm ^{13}C_{carb}$ is generally around 0&permil; and $\\delta \\rm ^{13}C_{org}$ is ${\\sim}30$&permil; in low-grade metasedimentary rocks.  Shallow marine carbonates in particular are very close to 0&permil; as far back in time as the undisputed sedimentary record goes.  Organic carbon isotopic values are similarly consistent, though with greater variability about their mean value.  Autotrophic fixation has almost certainly been the predominant process of primary biological productivity on Earth since at least 3.5 Ga.\n",

When these molecules have a specific biological source (e.g., [Domain Bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-domain_system#Domain_Bacteria) or the [Phylum Porifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge)), they are called biomarkers.  There are many such biomarker molecules, but most that survive in mature rocks are derived from cellular lipids (i.e., cell membrane and pigments).  At high temperatures, the abundance and range of hydrocarbon molecules decreases markedly because long chains break down into methane.  But it is now clear that hydrocarbon biomarkers can also be used to inform us about life's early diversity.\n",

    "Microfossils have been reported from Isua, but these have now been dismissed as either fluid inclusions or weathered carbonate crystals.  Biomarker molecules have also been reported from these rocks, but the preservation of such complex chemicals under these severe conditions is even less likely than microfossils and experiments have shown that it is unlikely that they are indigenous.  It seems that only isotopic geochemical data are robust enough to provide satisfactory evidence of life and even then, there interpretation can be fraught with problems.  In particularly ancient terrains (e.g., early Archean of Greenland) several abiogenic sources could have contributed isotopically light carbon to the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks.\n",

Such extremely light values are only biologically produced by methane-fueled metabolisms that require free oxygen or high sulfate, for which there is no evidence so early in Earth's history.  Inorganic scenarios scenarios seem more likely now that it has been shown that the host rock is not a metamorphosed banded iron formation, but is apparently a highly deformed and metasomatized ultramafic igneous rock.  Field relations indicate that that the rocks may not be as old as previously believed, where apatite grains return $\\rm U-Pb$ dates of just ${\\sim}1.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$.

    "#### Physical Characteristics\n",
    "Though there is little preserved evidence, it all suggests that the earliest organisms were morphologically simple.  All genuine Archean microfossils are of spheroidal or ellipsoidal single cells that reproduced by binary fission, or of cylindrical sheaths that surrounded filamentous chains of linked cells.  Usually the cells are aggregated into clusters with many representatives of each morphological type present.  Though only a limited range of morphological and size diversity is evident in the Archean microfossil record, this does not necessarily mean taxonomic diversity was similarly restricted.  Microbes are in general architecturally conservative, so beneath the disguise of a simple spheroid or filament may have lurked a wide range of metabolic styles and phylogenetic diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community organization was also apparently simple.  Assemblages of microfossils are locally homogenous, as are stromatolite microstructures.  [Benthic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthic_zone) filaments (that lived on the floors of bodies of water) formed interwoven mats, and spheroids grew in dense clusters that provided protection for individuals against radiation, erosion, and desiccation.  Some microbial communities were clearly very robust (e.g., many stromatolites in northwestern Australia), which were able to accommodate frequent deluges of coarse volcanic ash into their structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest late Archean filamentous microfossils are no more than a few hundred microns in length.  Individual cells must have been much smaller with the greatest possible diameter allowed by the filaments being ${\\sim}20\\ {\\rm \\mu m}$.  The layering of stromatolites also provides a proxy gauge for the size of the constructing organisms.  Evidently the Archean biota was entirely microbial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environmental Preferences\n",
    "It used to be dogma in geology textbooks that the Archean environment was exclusively hot, volcanic and deep-water, but this is not so.  A wide range of environmental settings are represented in the Archean geological record and life was present in many of them by the end of the eon.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Benthic organisms (living on the sea floor) clearly flourished in the photic zone, where sunlight is present (e.g., stromatolites).  Sediment-accreting microbial mats formed wherever light was available and other conditions were suitable (e.g., temperature, pH, etc.)  Periodic exposure and strong currents were not much of a restriction.\n",
    "- Marine plankton (organisms that float) must also have been abundant, because (kerogenous) shales deposited well below the photic zone are widespread in Archean deep-water environments.  The organic material must have been largely produced by organisms living at shallow depths.  Some late Archean black shales deposited at considerable depths contain hydrocarbon biomarkers for photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which can only have lived in the photic zone as plankton.\n",
    "- Both benthic and marine planktonic microbes also inhabited non-marine aqueous settings (e.g., lakes).  A wide range of stromatolite morphologies occur in [lacustrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacustrine_deposits) (deposits in lakes) rocks, occupying similar depth and salinity ranges as comparable marine stromatolites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite much debate, it is still unclear whether land surfaces were inhabited during the Archean.  There has been a long-held belief that before the advent of an oxygenated atmosphere with its ozone shield, life on land would have been impossible because the high solar UV flux would have destroyed the DNA of exposed organisms.  However, endolithic and soil microbes could have thrived where UV light could not penetrate.  The oldest noncontroversial record of life on land dates from only $1.2\\ {\\rm Ga}$, but colonization of the land was undoubtedly earlier because land settings are prone to erosion and thus unlikely to preserve relics of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another widespread belief about early organisms is that they were thermophilic, based on the heat-loving tendencies of many modern microbes that appear to be ancient based on their basal branching on ribosomal RNA phylogenetic trees.  It is difficult to determine from the geological and paleontological records whether the Archean biota in fact reflected this tendency.  A constraint on temperature is provided by the sequence of sulfate minerals precipitated from evaporating seawater.  As relics of halite ($\\rm NaCl$) are preserved in old marine sediments elsewhere, the evaporite brine was probably rich in chloride.  This implies that the water in which the stromatolites formed was cool and thus that the earliest microbial community was not dominated by thermophiles."

This phylogeny works on the assumption that slowly evolving and universally shared molecules will reveal evolutionary relationships through the history of life.  Though it is a powerful device for exploring early evolution, it has significant drawbacks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Clear evidence for Bacteria in the Archean is provided in the presence in sediments of $2.72\\ {\\rm Ga}$ and younger.  A biomarker for cyanobacteria is also present in these sediments.  But an earlier dater for the appearance of Bacteria can be obtained from the sulfur isotope systematics of ${\\sim}3.47\\ {\\rm Ga}$ [baritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryte) sediments in the Warrawoona Group.  Given the current knowledge of the phylogenetic distribution of thermal adaptions among sulfate reducers, the Warrawoona $\\delta {\\rm ^{34}S}$ data suggest a minimum age of $3.47\\ {\\rm Ga}$ for the appearance of Bacteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of the domain Eukarya can also be traced back to the Archean.  The diversity and abundance of indigenous [sterane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterane) biomarkers (steroid precursors) in sediments of the $2.8-2.5\\ {\\rm Ga}$ Groups of northwest Australia indicates the presence of eukaryotes in the Archean ecosystem.  Steroids as as rigidifying molecules within the lipid bilayers that make up cell membranes, and provide eukaryotes with the ability to engulf large particles leading to the possibility of endosymbiosis of organelles.  They are intimately involved with the evolution of microstructural complexity within cells, and are necessary precursors to the development of multicellularity, tissue differentiation, and sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some steranes are characteristic of particular subdivisions of eukaryotes, none of those are abundant in the Archean biomarker suites.  It is impossible to determine which types of eukaryotic organisms were present on the early Earth.  They may have been single-celled algae, but there is nothing in the biomarker data that precludes large multicellular organisms as complex as red algae or even animals."

Multicellular organisms (e.g., plants, animals, and fungi) evolved a mere $0.5-1.0\\ {\\rm Ga}$ from single-celled eukaryotic ancestors.  Eukaryotes are single-cell microorganisms with flexible cytoskeletal structures, organelles, and chromosomes bound within a nuclear membrane.  Cyanobacterium-like fossils suggest that life emerged at least $3.45\\ {\\rm Ga}$, but the biogenic origins of these structures are contested.  The chemical record documents prokaryotic metabolisms that may have existed $3.47-3.85\\ {\\rm Ga}$ and eukaryotic biosignatures that may be as old as 2.7 Gyr.\n",

Even today, single-cell eukaryotes (i.e., members of the group [*Protista*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist)), and prokaryotes continue to dominate our biosphere in terms of genetic diversity, total biomass, and metabolic activity.  Microbes are usually members of complex communities and are directly or indirectly responsible for all of Earth's biogeochemical cycles.  The multicellular world is completely dependent upon diverse microbial species for continued survival.  If life exists on a world beyond Earth, it would be microbial, either now or in its earliest days.  Understanding Earth's evolutionary history or the kinds of life most likely to be encountered beyond Earth requires that we study the history, habitats, ecology, and full diversity of microorganisms that shape our biosphere.\n",

Physical appearance is insufficient, but most of these creatures have small genomes that are more amenable to DNA sequence analyses (as compared to the larger genomes of planets and animals).  Today molecular data provide a practical metric for assessing biodiversity in the context of evolutionary history.  The comparison of DNA sequences that share a common ancestry makes possible the measurement of genetic differences that are common to members of populations, species, or kingdoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal strategy for reconstructing evolutionary history would be to sequence the entire genomes of all species that might inform us about microbial phylogeny.  Protists can present technological challenges because their chromosomes can be large and a single genome can contain millions (or even billions) of [base pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair).  If we sequenced *entire* genomes, adequate sampling in the grouping of organisms (i.e., Taxon) for molecular evolution studies would require impractically large resources.  However, gene sequencing technology has made leaps over the past decade with many medical applications [(Koboldt et al. 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969849/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct evolutionary trees, specific genes are isolated from the genome.  Because different genes, domains with a gene, or specific nucleotide positions can display dissimilar rates of evolutionary change, the selection of a particular gene (or suite of genes) for phylogenetic analysis depends upon the evolutionary distances separating the organisms.  For example, for closely related species slowly evolving genes may show an insufficient number of differences to resolve evolutionary patterns.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, sequences for rapidly evolving genes are of little value for inferring phylogenies that span the major domains of life.\n",

    "- To infer evolutionary relationships, compared sequences must contain a statistically significant number of variable sites.\n",
    "- Ideally the sequences should also span several functional domains (i.e., regions of the genome that serve different purposes).  This condition allows recognition of [convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution), which is when structures or molecules come to resemble each other even though they have independent evolutionary sources (e.g., wings of birds, bats, and pterosaurs).  If identical trees are found in two sequence domains that can vary independently, we have divergent evolution from a common ancestor.\n",

Comparisons of subunit rRNA led to a new understanding of the *Universal Tree of Life* and its three primary lineages.  Understanding how the primary lineages are interrelated is a question of great interest.  A simplistic interpretation of the Universal Tree of Life is that the history of life on Earth was a series of bifurcating events leading to millions of terminal nodes.  The competing view is that Earth's current biodiversity was strongly shaped by frequent lateral gene transfer, which would make it difficult to identify the earliest diverging lineages within each of the primary lines of descent.  Through exploration of evolutionary history, we can also address other issues that are important to astrobiologists.\n",

[Thomas Cavalier-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cavalier-Smith) introduced the term *Archezoa* to refer to the apparently most primitive eukaryotes.  In one model of how the major eukaryotic organelles were assembled, those lineages appearing before the acquisition of mitochondria occurred prior to the largely unresolved radiation of many eukaryotic lineages.\n",

The absence of introns in early diverging eukaryotes and most prokaryotes suggested their relatively late introduction ito microbial genomes.  If mitochondria were not present or required for eukaryotic life, protists could have appeared prior to the advent of significant oxygen within Earth's atmosphere.  However, the discovery of bacterial-like molecular chaperones in putatively deep-branching amitochondriate protists suggests that symbionts ancestral to mitochondria could have been present in the early stages of eukaryote evolution.  The absence of mitochondria may be a secondary adaptation to anaerobic environments.\n",

Impact rates were extremely high during the Earth's early history (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<bombardment-fig>`), and the substantial heating of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and upper curst my massive objects may have caused an [impact frustration of life](https://www.nature.com/articles/331612a0) (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<impact-frustration-fig>`). \n",

    "A late large impact may well have heated the upper portions of our planet sufficiently to have killed off all nonthermophilic organisms.  Thus, the thermophile root of the phylogenetic tree might be the result of an impact-induced heating event that killed off all life not tolerant of high temperatures.  In this case, life could have originated in either a cool or a hot environment.  Life and the planet(s) that it occupies can affect each other in many ways, and it is not possible to have a complete understanding of one without knowledge of the other.\n",
