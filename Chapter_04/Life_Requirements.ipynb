    "## Does 'Life' Have a Definition?\n",
    "The question \"What is life?\" is foundational to biology, but it is especially important to astrobiologists searching for signs of life in the cosmos.  Previous attempts to define *life* have faced serious counterexamples, and may generate as many problems as they solve.  To answer the question \"What is life?\", we require a general theory of the nature of living systems.  In absence of such a theory, we like alchemists during the European Enlightenment trying to define water before the advent of atomic theory.  The best description of water at the time would be to list water's properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- wet,\n",
    "- transparent,\n",
    "- odorless,\n",
    "- tasteless,\n",
    "- thirst quenching, and \n",
    "- a good solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, finding water that was odorless and tasteless might have been a struggle for the average 16th century investigator.  No amount of (macroscopic) observational or conceptual analysis  of these features will reveal that water contains two hydrogens and one oxygen ($\\rm H_2O$).  The most scientifically informative answer to the question \"What is water?\" is most definitely $\\rm H_2O$.  In the absence of a good theory of the nature of living systems, the best we can do is to describe its features until we have a more precise intuition."

    "### Attempts to Define 'Life'\n",
    "There have been many attempts to define *life* dating back at least to Aristotle, who defined *life* in terms of the capacity to reproduce.  To this day, there is not a broadly accepted definition of *life*, where the scientific literature is filled with suggestions.  Carl Sagan catalogued physiological, metabolic, biochemical, Darwinian (or genetic) and thermodynamic definitions, along with their counterexamples.  All attempts typically face problems, in that they include phenomena that most are reluctant to consider alive, or exclude entities that clearly are alive.  Figure {numref}`{number}<life-defined-fig>` shows a definition, but it actually relies on many definitions to form a complete picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *metabolic* definition could be based on the ability to consume and convert energy in order to move, grow, or reproduce.  But fire might be said to satisfy some or all of these criteria.\n",
    "- A *thermodynamic* definition might describe a living system as one that takes in energy in order to create order locally, but this would include crystals that are not generally considered alive.\n",
    "- A *biochemical* definition would be based on the presence of certain types of biomolecules, yet one must worry that any such choice could in the future face exceptions when the category of favored biomolecules changes.  In that case, once living things would become non-living.\n",
    "- *Genetic* or *Darwinian* definitions are systems that are capable of evolution by natural selection, but these also face drawbacks.  The taming (i.e. altered behavior) of wolves into dogs appears to fit this definition, but a behavior is not considered alive by itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "The philosophical question of the definition of *life* has increasing practical importance, as laboratory experiments approach the synthesis of life, and as greater attention is focused on the search for life within the Solar System and beyond.  Definitions of life are often explicit or implicit in planning remote *in situ* searches for extraterrestrial life.  The design of life-detection experiment that could be performed on Europa or Mars by spacecraft landers depends on decisions about what life is, and what observations will count as evidence of a detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viking's Search for Life on Mars\n",
    "The Viking mission's search for life on Mars in the mid-1970s was the first dedicated *in situ* search for extraterrestrial life.  The basic approach was to conduct experiments with the martian soil to test for the presence of metabolizing organisms.  The results of the [labeled release experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander_biological_experiments#Labeled_release) (see the LR in Fig. {numref}`{number}<viking-experiments-fig>`) in particular were not unlike what had been expected for the presence of life.  In the end, the Viking biology team's consensus was for a *nonbiological* interpretation, which was strongly influenced by the failure of the Viking gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) to find any organic molecules to its limits of detection in the soil with sample heating up to $500\\ {\\rm ^\\circ C}$.\n",

    "The GCMS was not intended to conduct a \"life-detection\" experiment, but actually did so by implicitly employing a biochemical definition.  The GCMS would not have detected as many as ${\\sim}10^6$ bacterial cells per gram of soil.  It now appears that oxidation of the meteoritic organics on the martian surface may have produced nonvolatile organic compounds that would not have been easily detectable.  The result was psychologically powerful: no (detected) organics, no life.  A lesson learned is that any *in situ* search for extraterrestrial life should employ more than one definition of life so that results can be intercompared.  If there were really *one* correct known definition of *life*, then the extra effort and design would be unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Darwinian Definition\n",
    "Darwinian (sometimes called *genetic*) definitions of *life* hold that life is a **system capable of evolution by natural selection**.  One popular version is the **chemical Darwinian** definition, where life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.  The notion of Darwinian evolution includes processes of self-reproduction, material continuation over a historical lineage (i.e., gene transfer), genetic variation, and natural selection.  The requirement the system is self-sustained refers to living systems that contain all the genetic information necessary for their own constant production (i.e., metabolism).  The chemical Darwinian definition excludes computer or artificial *life* through its demand that chemical exchanges are responsible for the self-sustaining property.  It also excludes biological viruses by virtue of the self-sustained requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers (e.g., [Dawkins (1983)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Evolution_From_Molecules_to_Men/KYM4AAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0); [Dennett (1995)](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1995.tb03633.x)) do not restrict Darwinian evolution to chemical systems, explicitly leaving open the possibility of computer life.  This characterizes Darwinian evolution by how it functions, or how it is more a general process that can be abstracted from any particular physical realization.  In this functionalist view, it is not the computer that is alive but rather the processes themselves.  This is similar to how energy propagates through a medium using waves, where the material at the wave source does not interact directly with the receiver.  The artificial vehicle of the computer has a status no different from that of the artificial glassware that might be used in a laboratory synthesis of organic life.  A computer simulation of cellular biochemistry is a simulation of biochemistry, and not biochemistry itself.  No computer simulation of photosynthesis is actually photosynthesis since it does not yield authentic carbohydrates.  In the functionalist view, the simulation *is* life because life is abstract process independent of any particular physical realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other problems with Darwinian definitions, where it is possible (though not generally favored) that early cellular life on Earth or some other work passed through a period reproduction without DNA-type replication and Darwinian evolution could not yet operate (e.g., [Dyson (1985)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Origins_of_Life/zulgAAAAMAAJ?hl=en)).  In this hypothesis, protein-based creatures capable of metabolism predated the development of exact replication based on nucleic acids.  If such entities, where discovered on another world, then Darwinian definitions would preclude them from being considered alive.  For more recent details (as of 2016), see [How to build life in a pre-Darwinian world](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-build-life-in-a-pre-darwinian-world-20160216/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple objection to the Darwinian definition considers that individual sexually reproducing organisms in our DNA-protein do not themselves evolve and would categorize many living entities in our world are not examples of *life*.  The Darwinian definition refers to a *system* that at least in some cases must contain more than one entity, which would preclude Victor Frankenstein's unique creation from begin consider alive, even though the tale clearly describes a living entity.  A practical drawback to Darwinian definitions is that they depend on how long a system should wait before demonstrating that it is capable of Darwinian evolution.  How do we decide what are the proper conditions for a system to be capable of Darwinian evolution?  \n",

    "### Definitions\n",
    "Definitions are concerned with language and concepts, at least philosophically.  For example, the definition of a \"bachelor\" is an unmarried human male, which explains the meaning of the word by dissecting the concept that we associate with it.  Every definition has two parts: (1) the [definiendum](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/definiendum) is the expression being defined and (2) the [definiens](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/definiens#English) is the expression doing the defining.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Varieties of Definition\n",
    "[Lexical definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_definition) report on the standard meaning of terms in a natural language (e.g., dictionary definitions).  Lexical definitions are in contrast to [stipulative definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipulative_definition), which explicitly introduce new meanings for terms.  The stipulative definition from physics for the term 'work' refers to the magnitude of an acting force and the displacement due to its action.  Stipulative definitions are also used to introduce invented terms (e.g., electron or gene).  Unlike lexical definitions, stipulative definitions are arbitrary in the sense that rather than reporting on the existing meanings of terms, they explicitly introduce new meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of definition is the [ostensive definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostensive_definition) that specify the meaning of a term merely by indicating a few prototypical examples within its extension, or the class of all things to which it applies.  An adult who explains the meaning of the word 'dog' to a child by pointing to a dog and saying \"that is a dog\" is providing an ostensive definition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Operational definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition) are like ostensive definitions, where they explain meanings through representative examples.  Operational definitions do not *directly* indicate examples, but instead specify procedures that can be performed on something to determine whether it falls into an extension of the definiendum.  For example, an acid can be operationally defined as something that turns litmus paper red.  The definiens specifies a procedure that can be used to determine whether an unknown substance is an acid.  Some astrobiologists (e.g., [Chyba & McDonald (1996)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cchyba/files/chybamcdonald_areps_1996.pdf); [Conrad & Nealson (2001)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AsBio...1...15C/abstract)) have called for the use of operational definitions in searches for extraterrestrial life.  The problem with operational definitions is that they do not tell one very much about what the items falling under the definiendum have in common.  The fact that litmus paper turns red when placed in a liquid doesn't tell us much about the nature of acidity, only that a particular liquid is something called acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most informative definitions specify the meanings of terms by analyzing concepts and supplying a noncircular synonym for the term begin defined.  In philosophy, such definitions are know as *full* or *complete* definitions.  Philosophers sometimes uses these expressions to designate more fine-grained distinctions, in which the term **ideal definition** is used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ideal Definitions\n",
    "Ideal definitions explain the meanings of terms by relating them to expression that we already understand.  It is important that the definiens make use of neither the term being defined nor on of its close cognates; otherwise the definition will be circular (e.g., defining a line as a linear path or a cause as something that produces an effect).  Someone that does not understand the meaning of the definiens 'cause' will also not understand the meaning of 'effect' since the definition of 'effect' may be something that is caused.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of 'bachelor' is not circular since the concept of being unmarried, human, and male does not presuppose an understanding of the concept of bachelor.  The definiens provides an informative analysis of the meaning of the definiendum 'bachelor'.  An ideal definition specifies the meaning of a term by reference to a logical conjunction of properties as opposed to representative examples (i.e., ostensive definition), or a procedure for recognizing examples (i.e., operational definition).  The conjunction of descriptions  determines the extension of the definiendum by specifying *necessary* and *sufficient* conditions for its application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A necessary condition for falling into the extension of a term is a condition *in whose absence the term does not apply*.  For example, \"Without a microscope, a person cannot see viruses.\"\n",
    "- A sufficient condition is a condition *in whose presence the term cannot fail to apply*. For example, \"For a shape to be a square, each of its sides is equal in length to each of the other sides.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Most proposed ideal definitions face borderline cases in which it is uncertain as to whether something satisfies the conjunction of predicates supplied by the definiens.  A good example is the question of whether a ten-year-old boy is a bachelor.  Even if this case is resolved by adding an additional condition (e.g., adult) to the definiens, there wil be other borderline cases because language is vague.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to distinguish a bald man from a man who is not bald in terms of the number of hairs on his head.  the fact that we cannot specify a crisp boundary does not show that there is no difference between being bald and not being bald.  Ideal definitions that specify necessary and sufficient conditions are rare.  We can often construct fairly satisfactory approximations of an ideal definition despite the problem of borderline cases.  If definitions of *life* faced nothing more serious than counterexamples (e.g., viruses), there might not be insurmountable problems.  Good definitions of *life* must deal with quartz crystals and candle flames, which are presumably not alive. "

    "### Natural Kinds\n",
    "Ideal definitions specify meaning by providing a complete analysis of the concepts associated with terms.  However, they do not supply good answers to question about the identity of **natural kinds**, or categories carved out by nature.  It is important to astrobiology because it seems likely that *life* is a natural kind term and represents an objective fact about the natural world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider trying to answer the question \"What is water?\" by defining the natural kind term 'water.'  The term 'water' could be defined by reference to its sensible properties (see Sect. {numref}`{number}<life_defn>`).  This definition of 'water' is not simply a matter of linguistic convention.  A reference to a list of sensible properties cannot exclude things that superficially resemble water but are not in fact water.  For example, the alchemists identified nitric acid (known as *aqua fortis*, or strong water) and mixtures of hydrochloric acid (known as *aqua regia*, or royal water) as water.  A mixture of alcohols was called *aqua vitae*, or water of life.  Even today, we classify various liquids in terms of their sensible properties (e.g., salt water, muddy water, and distilled water).  Which of the sensible properties (e.g., transparency or tastelessness) are more important to the definition of water?  \n",

So one would say that it suffers change into as many natures as are the different places through which it passes. And as the mirror changes with the colour of its object so it changes with the nature of the place through which it passes: health-giving, noisome, laxative, astringent, sulphurous, salt, incarnadined, mournful, raging, angry, red, yellow, green, black, blue, greasy, fat, thin.\n",

The identification of water with $\\rm H_2O$ explains why liquids can resemble water and not be water because their molecular composition is more than $\\rm H_2O$ alone.  In addition, the identification holds regardless of whether the water is in any of its familiar forms (solid, liquid, or gas), and it wil hold equally well in the less familiar high-pressure phases.  The Aristotelian view of water as one of the basic elements began to fall into disfavor with a paper from Antoine Lavoisier (1783) that showed water is not an element, but can be decomposed and recombined.\n",

    "The identification of water with $\\rm H_2O$ does not have the character of an ideal definition.  It cannot be viewed as explicating the concept that has historically been associated with the term 'water' because that concept encompasses stuff varying widely in chemical and physical composition.

    "If life is a natural kind, then attempts to define *life* are fundamentally misguided.  Definitions serve only to explain the concepts that we currently associate with terms.  Concepts cannot reveal the objecting underlying nature (or lack thereof) of the categories designated by natural kind terms.  It is the underlying nature (not the concepts in our heads) that we are interested in when we use a natural kind term.

    "#### Dreams of a General Theory of Life\n",
    "To formulate a convincing theoretical identity statement for lif, we need a general theory of living systems.  Our current sample size for such a theory is one (i.e., terrestrial life), which is a problem.  Although the morphological diversity of terrestrial life is extraordinary, all known life on Earth is also extraordinarily similar in its biochemistry.  With the exception of some viruses, the hereditary material of all known life on Earth is DNA of the same right-handed [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality#Biology).  Life on Earth utilizes 20 amino acids to construct proteins, and these amino acis are typically of left-handed chirality.  These biochemical similarities lead to the conclusion that life on Earth had a single origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Darwinian evolution then explains how this common biochemical framework yielded such an amazing diversity of life.  It is difficult to decide which features of terrestrial life are common to all *life* (wherever it may be found) because the biochemical similarities of all life on Earth can be explained in terms of a single origin.  Many biochemical features that strike us as important may derive from mere chemical or physical contingencies present at the time life originated on Earth ([Sagan (1974)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974OrLi....5..497S/abstract)).   \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we discriminate the contingent from the essential?  It is a bit like trying to come up with a theory of mammals when one can observe only zebras.  What features of zebras should one focus upon (e.g., their stripes or mammary glands)?  The mammary glands (although present in only some zebras) tells us more about what it means to be a mammal than do the ubiquitous stripes.  Without access to living things with a different historical origin, it is difficult to formulate an adequately general theory of living systems.  This problem is not unique to life, where it reflects a simple logical point.  One cannot generalize from a single example.  Biochemical analyses coupled with knowledge of evolution suggests that much of the diversity observed on Earth may be a historical accident.  Had the history of the Earth been different, lief on Earth would certainly be different.  In essence, the common origin of contemporary terrestrial life blinds us to the possibilities for life in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many definitions of *life* cite sensible properties of terrestrial life, such as metabolism, reproduction, complex hierarchical structure, and self-regulation.  But defining *life* in terms of sensible properties is analogous to defining water as being wet, transparent, tasteless, etc.  Reference to sensible properties for water is unable to exclude things that are not water and to include everything that is water (e.g., ice).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Search for Extraterrestrial Life\n",
    "There remains the problem of how to hunt for extraterrestrial life without either a definition of *life* or a general theory of living systems.  One approach is to treat the feature that we currently use as *tentative criteria* for life.  The features will then necessarily be inconclusive, where their absence cannot be taken as sufficient for concluding that something is not alive.  Therefore, they cannot be viewed as providing operational definitions of *life*.  The purpose of using tentative criteria is not to definitively settle the issue of whether something is alive, but rather to focus attention on possible candidates (i.e., physical systems whose status as living or non-living is genuinely unclear).\n",
    "\n",
    "The criteria should include a wide diversity of features of terrestrial life, where diversity is absolutely crucial when one is looking for extinct extraterrestrial life (e.g., in the martian meteorite [ALH84001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Hills_84001), or with instrument packages delivered to ancient martian flood plains).  Some feature for shaping searches for extraterrestrial life may not even be universal to terrestrial life.  For example, features that are common only to life found in certain terrestrial environments may prove more useful for for searching for life in analogous extraterrestrial environments than are features that are universal to terrestrial life.  Features that are common or non-existent among non-living terrestrial systems may make good criteria for present or past life because the stand out against the background of non-living processes.  The chains of chemically pure, single-domain magnetite crystals found in ALH84001 provide a potential example.  If it turns out that these chains can only be produced biogenically, then they will provide a good biosignature for life, despite the fact that most terrestrial bacteria do not produce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind our strategy for searching for extraterrestrial life is to employ empirically well-founded (albeit provisional) criteria that increase the probability of recognizing extraterrestrial life while minimizing the chances of being misled by inadequate definitions.  This is similar in spirit to suggestions that *in situ* searches for extraterrestrial life should rely when possible on contrasting definitions of life.  The important point is to included the potential boundaries of our current concept of life.  It is only in this way that we can move beyond our geocentric ideas and recognize genuinely weird extraterrestrial life, should we be fortunate enough to encounter it.\n",

    "#### Limits to Life\n",
    "There are two somewhat different approaches to the question of the limits to life:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to determine the requirements for life\n",
    "- to determine the extreme environments in which adapted organisms (i.e., extremophiles) can survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements for life on Earth broadly include four items: (1) energy, (2) carbon, (3) liquid water, and (4) various other elements.  In our Solar System, it is the occurrence of liquid water that appears to limit the occurrence of habitable environments, and it appears to be the case for exoplanetary systems as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first requirement arises from basic thermodynamic considerations, where it is clear that life requires a source of energy.  Life on Earth uses only one energy source: that associated with the transfer of electrons by chemical reactions of reduction and oxidation to power metabolism and growth.  Methane-producing microbes use the reaction of $\\rm CO_2$ with $\\rm H_2$ to produce $\\rm CH_4$.  Photosynthetic organisms use a light-absorbing protein (e.g., chlorophyll, [bacteriochlorophylls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriochlorophyll), and [bacteriorhodopsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin)) to convert photon energy to the energy of an electron which then completes a redox reaction.  This occurs in the mitochondria in of most eukaryotes and in the cell membrane of prokaryotic cells.  Although life can detect and generate other energy sources (including magnetic, kinetic, gravitational, thermal gradient, and electrostatic), none of these is used for metabolic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon has the dominant role as the backbone molecule for Earth life and is widespread in the Solar System.  However, carbon may not be that useful as an indicator because the Earth is significantly depleted in carbon compared with the outer Solar System.  The vast majority of the carbon on Earth is stored in sedimentary rocks within the crust.  However, light carbon-containing molecules (e.g., $\\rm CO_2$, $\\rm CO$, and $\\rm CH_4$) are volatile, which means adequate carbon is present at the surface of the terrestrial planets.\n",

    "### From Lamarck to Darwin to the Central Dogma\n",
    "The basic notion of evolution is that inherited changes in populations of organisms result in expressed differences over time.  These differences are at the gene level (i.e., *genotype*) and/or expression of the gene into an identifiable characteristic (i.e., *phenotype*).  The important underlying fact of evolution is that all organism share a common ancestor.  We see this in the universal nature of the genetic code and in the *unity of biochemistry*:\n",
    "\n",
    "- all organisms share the same biochemical tools to translate the universal information code from genes to proteins,\n",
    "- all proteins are composed of the same twenty essential amino acids, and\n",
    "- all organisms derive energy from metabolic, catalytic, and biosynthetic processes from the same high energy organic compounds (e.g., adenosine triphosphate (ATP)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Darwin's [*On the Origin of Species*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2009/2009-h/2009-h.htm) describes his theory of evolution using evidence that included an ancient Earth, which geologists at the time (in 1859) believed to be in the millions of years.  Darwin also took the extinction of species to ba a real phenomenon since fossils existed that were without living representatives.  Since different species showed close phenotypic similarities, he argued that existing organisms descended from other organisms including extinct groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to his evolutionary theory was that inherited characteristics of organisms can change through time and that these changes occurred *gradually* and without discontinuities.  [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck) recognized (in 1809) a similar principle of evolution and offered an explanation generally referred to as *inheritance of acquired characters*.  Lamarck meant that the variation in characteristics or adaptations seen in organisms were acquired in response to the environment.  Classic examples include the long neck of the giraffe as an adaptation for foraging tender foliage on treetops, or the use of long legs by some aquatic fowl to venture into deep waters in search of prey.  Under Darwinian principles they were not acquired as a response to the needs of the environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Darwin's major contributions was his explanation of how and why organisms change over time and how they acquire characteristics useful for living in different environments.  Darwin referred to the mechanism for character changes through time as *natural selection*.  Natural selection is based on the idea of the struggle for existence (i.e., *survival of the fittest*) in populations where there are more individuals of each species than can survive.  A variation in any characteristic of an individual that gives an advantage in surviving (and reproducing) will be \"naturally selected\" since the new trait will be preferentially inherited by subsequent generations (see Fig. {numref}`{number}<descent-modification-fig>` or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/natural-selection/natural-selection-ap/a/darwin-evolution-natural-selection) for more detail).  Darwin differed from Lamarck by recognizing that character changes that offer a survival advantage and are \"naturally selected\" originate from a pool of randomly generated character changes that are not directed by environmental conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Darwin proposed his theory without knowing the mechanism for the inheritance of acquired traits.  Forty years later, the field of genetics would begin with the recognition that Gregor Mendel's principle of discrete units of inheritance (i.e., genes) was correct.\n",

This immediately led to the discovery by [Watson & Crick (1953)](https://www.mskcc.org/teaser/1953-nature-papers-watson-crick-wilkins-franklin.pdf) of the double-helix structure of DNA.

Usually ribosomal RNA genes and ribosomal protein genes are used for evolutionary studies because they have *highly conserved* sequences (i.e., sequences that are found across all domains of life).  Most functional RNA molecules have secondary structure that are associated with their function.  Mutations that change the secondary structure of RNA molecules will frequently render them inactive.  These conserved sequences must have originated a long time ago in a common ancestor and are fundamentally important to all species.\n",

    "All extant organisms have a set of conserved genes for repairing mutations or proteins affected by environmental stresses (e.g., starvation, heat, radiation, changes in pH, etc.).  Stress genes greatly reduce the number of deleterious mutations, while they are not 100% effective.  The same genes can also targe other specific genes for an *increased* mutation rate under stress conditions, which are called *stress-directed adaptive mutations*.  This mechanism can be observed when bacteria are starving, but undergo increased evolutionary rates of specific genes involved in the metabolism of alternative nutrients for growth.\n",

An example of punctuated equilibrium is the sudden appearance of diverse animal forms during the Cambrian explosion 550 million years ago (or 550 Ma).

    "### Mechanisms for Acquiring New Genes\n",
    "Other mechanisms (besides mutation) can effect changes in genes that coordinate cell structures, metabolism, or physiological traits through the sudden acquisition of new genes or incremental changes of individual genes or groups of genes. Theses mechanisms are:\n",

    "- fusion of different cells (i.e., [endosymbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont)),\n",

    "\n",
    "[Symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis) is any interaction between two organisms in which at least one of the organisms benefits from the relationship.  This broad definition includes [parasitic associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism) in which the parasite benefits at the expense of the host, or [mutualistic associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)) in which both organisms benefit.  Some symbiotic associations are obligatory, where either the host or symbiont (or both) is unable to live independently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the first [eukaryote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) cell (i.e., cell with a nucleus) may have formed by the *fusion* of Bacteria and Archaea, where the Bacteria contributed the operational genes while the Archaea contributed the informational genes ([Rivera & Lake (2004)](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~gerstein/VEG/Rivera%20and%20Lake%202004%20Nature.pdf)).  Such a fusion would fall into the category of mutualistic symbiosis since both cells benefited from this association.  There is evidence that ancient symbioses in eukaryote cells, where their mitochondria (for oxygen respiration) and chloroplasts (for photosynthesis) both firs occurred in specific groups of bacteria (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion#Origin_and_evolution) for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed fusion of an archaeum with a bacterium somehow resulted in conditions favorable for evolution to greater complexity, multicellularity, and sexual reproduction.  The later acquisition by early eukaryotes of the mitochondria and chloroplast from bacteria allowed eukaryotes to adapt into habitats with abundant light and oxygen (i.e., aerobic environment).  Unfortunately, ost of the evolutionary steps from the proposed fusion-based \"proto-eukaryote\" to single-cell eukaryotes are unknown since no known extant organism retains the intermediate characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *fusion of two cells* is not believed to have been a common occurrence in the early life history of organisms, but there are many examples of other forms of symbiosis that are widely distributed in eukaryotes and allow them to live under conditions that would be otherwise impossible.  One of the first cases was the symbiosis of an alga (singular of algae) and a fungus to form a lichen, which was recognized and researched in detail by Beatrix Potter (author of Peter Rabbit) well before symbiosis was accepted by the British scientific community.\n",

    "*Parasitism* can result in radical changes in the physiology of the host that include mating and feeding behavior, as well as morphological changes.  *Coevolution* is a special kind of symbiosis, in which two kinds of organisms interact in such a way that each exerts a selective pressure on the other.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entity on Earth, year are poorly understood.  It is presumed that the primary role of viruses in the environment is causing death in bacteria (or producing disease in eukaryotes), but their significance as vehicle for transmitting new genes to bacteria *in situ* is not well understood, although likely extensive.  [Jiang & Paul (1998)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.64.8.2780-2787.1998) calculated that at the low infection rate of $10^{-8}$ per infected bacterial population, viral-mediated gene transfer takes place in Earth's oceans at the rate of ${\\sim}2\\times 10^{16}$ per second.\n",

For example, ${\\sim}16\\%$ of the genome of [*Escherichia coli* K12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli) is viral genes.  Microorganisms have evolved elaborate mechanism for incorporation acquired genes into their chromosome at specific sites.  These sites can serve as \"pathogenicity islands\" if all of the acquired genes are involved in disease production, or they may be \"genetic islands,\" which align acquired genes in involved in key physiological activities (e.g., [magnetotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotaxis)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very unlikely that the formation of a genome with sufficient information to lead to free-living (self-sufficient) cells could have originated without a mechanism fro acquiring \"functional\" genes form other early cells or communities of interdependent cells or \"precells\" ([Baross & Hoffman (1985)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01808177)).  This is certainly consistent with the fact that all life on Earth is derived from a common ancestral pool of genes based on a universal genetic code.  Darwinian evolution would have played an important role in these early stages and selection would have favored specific biochemical and molecular structures and mechanism over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could this imply that if we started over again by resetting the clock to 4 billion years ago (4 Ga), the resultant life would have the same biochemical and molecular properties (including the same genetic code) as present-day Earth life?  If environmental conditions and the starting pool of organic compounds were the same, it is probable that a second genesis would result in biochemistry that would resemble or possibly be indistinguishable from present-day Earth life.  In such a scenario, contingency in evolution could result in the selection of organisms and ecosystems significantly different from those found on Earth.  Compared to present-day organisms, they would share a similar biochemistry and evolve many or all of the sme phenotypes (both structural and functional) albeit possibly with different genotypes."

    "The only alternative to evolution for producing diversity would be to have environmental conditions that continuously create different life forms, or similar life forms with random and frequent \"mistakes\" made in the synthesis of chemical templates used for replication or metabolism.  These lead to traits that gave some selective advantage in an existing community or in exploiting new habitats.  This could lead to life forms that undergo a form of evolution without a master information macromolecule (e.g., DNA or RNA).  It is difficult to image such lef forms being able to \"evolve\" into complex structures unless other mechanism, such as symbiosis or cell-cell fusion are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution and Extraterrestrial Life\n",
    "Evolution is the key mechanism for heritable changes to occur in a population. Mutation is not the only mechanism for acquiring new genes.  Lateral gene transfer appears to be one of the most important mechanisms and clearly one the earliest for creating diversity and possibly for building genomes with the requisite information to result in free-living cells (as opposed to codependent communities of \"precells\" that are unable to escape communal life).   Lateral gene transfer is also one of the mechanisms to align genes from different sources into complex functional activities.  The coevolution between two or more species is also a hallmark of evolution manifested in many ways from insect-planet interactions to the hundreds of species of bacteria involved in the nutrition of ruminant animals (e.g., cows, sheep, goats, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ability to undergo Darwinian evolution is a canonical trait of life no matter how different that life form is from Earth life, then are there properties of evolving extraterrestrial organism that would be detectable as positive signs of life?  Evolution provides organism the opportunity to exploit new and changing environments.  One piece of evidence for the probable cosmic ubiquity of evolution is that, on Earth, life occupies all available habitats and even creates new habitats as a consequence of its metabolisms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another hallmark of evolution is the ability of organisms to coevolve with other organisms and to form permanent (and obligatory) associations.  It is highly probable that an inevitable consequence of evolution is the elimination of radically different biochemical lineages of life that may have formed during the earliest period of evolution of life.  Extant Earth life is the result of either selection of the most fit lineage or homogenization  of some or all fo the different lineages into a common ancestral community that developed into the present three major lineages (domains).  All have a common biochemistry based on presumably the most \"fit\" molecular information strategies and energy yielding pathways among a potpourri of possibilities.  One caveat and perhaps verification of the above statement is that some of the deeply rooted archaea exist as remnants of other lineages.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the apparent generalizations that can be made from extant Earth life (and the explanation of a \"unity of biochemistry\" in all organisms) is that lateral gene transfer is both an ancient and efficient mechanism for rapidly creating diversity and complexity.  Lateral gene transfer is also an efficient mechanism for selecting the genes that are most \"fit\" for specific proteins and transferring them into diverse groups of organisms.  the result is both the addition of new genes and the replacement of less-fit genes having a similar function.  Natural selection based solely on mutation is not likely and adequate mechanism for evolving complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lateral gene transfer and endosymbiosis are probably the most obvious mechanisms for creating complex genomes that can lead to free-living cells and complex cellular communities in the short geological time available from life's origins to the establishment of microbial communities 3.8 Ga.  An important implication of the existence of viruses or virus-like entities during the early evolution of cellular organism is that their genomes may have been the source of most genetic innovations, due to their (1) rapid replication rates, (2) high rates of mutation from replication errors, and (3) gene insertions from diverse host cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that both the individual organism and its community coevolve.  Evolution is allowing cells to control their own evolution, where they accept or reject changes in genotypes from newly acquired foreign genes.  The source of foreign genes and the kinds of genes most likely to be selected for permanence are largely not known.  It is clear that the evolution f a useful trait by one organism frequently means that it is likely to be acquired by other organisms.  It appears that biology is transitioning from just on genes to a broader emphasis on the cell, communities, and ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the limits of evolution for Earth life?**  This is a complex question with many different components.  It involves the different biochemistries from carbon chemistry that are not found in extant Earth organism, but could be better suited for environmental conditions that exist on other planets and moons.  The technology exists to design genes and groups of genes that could lead to novel phenotypes suited to exploit new habitats and energy sources (e.g., petroleum eating bacteria).  These kinds of studies would be important and perhaps essential in our quest to search for life elsewhere.  Another component to the question is where *we* are going and what will *Homo sapiens* be like in 10,000 years?  This is an integral part of our search for advanced extraterrestrial intelligence, which requires us to imagine our future portrait.  One possible outcome will be an increasing ability to control our environment and all that is evolving based on our history in primate evolution.

Carbonate rock (the majority of which is located in Earth's mantle) forms the largest reservoir.  Silicate rocks and atmospheric $\\rm CO_2$ can react with each other with the aid of liquid water to form silica and carbonate rocks.  In some cases, living organisms are involved, while in other cases they are not.\n",

Some of the carbon is returned via respiration, while a portion remains isolated for long periods of time as fossils.  However, the [carbonate-silicate cycle](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_03/Planetary_Heating_and_Atmospheres.html#id1) introduces the products of silicate weathering, including calcium $(\\rm Ca^{++})$, bicarbonate $(\\rm HCO_3^-)$, and dissolved silica $(\\rm SiO_2)$, which are transported by rivers to the ocean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Organisms (e.g., [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera)) use these products to make shells of calcium carbonate $(\\rm CaCO_3)$, while other organisms make shells out of silica.  Most of these shells eventually dissolve, but some are buried in sediments on the seafloor.  On a lifeless planet, calcium carbonate (i.e., chalk upon precipitation) would be incorporated in ocean sediments through nonbiological chemistry until the mineral reaches a high enough concentration to become saturated in seawater.  The combination of silicate weathering plus carbonate precipitation is given in Eqn. {eq}`silicate_weathering`.  Thermal processing of buried carbonate rocks returns $\\rm CO_2$ to the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The episodic return of $\\rm CO_2$ to the atmosphere affects the climate, where for the past few million years, the climate cycle on Earth has alternated between ice ages and interglacials (i.e., periods between ice ages).  When the climate cools, ice sheets form because the ice is highly reflective (i.e., has a high albedo) and this change leads to further cooling through a [positive feedback](https://saturnaxis.github.io/Astrobio/Chapter_03/Planetary_Heating_and_Atmospheres.html#climate-evolution) loop.  \n",

    "Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria produce $\\rm O_2$ as a waste product, while methanogenic organisms release $\\rm CH_4$.  Some of this methane rises to the stratosphere and is photodissociated.  A portion of the hydrogen formed by dissociation continues moving upwards to the exosphere and subsequently escapes.  For the first few billion years, Earth's atmosphere and crust were sufficiently reducing that they were capable of absorbing the released oxygen.  Some processes (e.g., hydrogen escape and long-term sequestration of carbon within the crust and the mantle) diminished the environment's ability to absorb oxygen, and eventually the $\\rm O_2$ abundance in our planet's atmosphere increased substantially.\n",

    "Biological processes play an important role in the carbon cycle.  Today's fossil fuels (e.g., coal, crude oil, and 'natural gas' (methane)) were produced from partially decayed planets and many now extinct organisms.
